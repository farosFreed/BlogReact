# React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase

A quick React + Supabase blog built to test Github Copilot workflows

# Notes

- Installed react-router but deprecated its use, it can be removed.
- Want to test writing tests with Copilot
- Did not create a single post view, but that would be the next step for this project.
